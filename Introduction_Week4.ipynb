Diversity of the migrated population opens new opportunity for the existing as well as new business. For example, Indian diaspora will be looking for Indian restaurant or Chinese diaspora will look for a Chinese restaurant. In this study, the goal is to recommend a place in Toronto for opening a Mexican Restaurant. The study will help making a smart and informed decision to select a neighborhood in Toronto to open a Mexican restaurant.\n\n## Problem Statement\nThe major goal of this project is to suggest a better neighborhood in Scarborough, Toronto to open a Mexican restaurant. Mexican food is popular not just among Mexicans but Canadians, Indians, and the people from other countries in South and North America. \n\n\n## The Location\nScarborough is a popular destination for new immigrants in Canada and a multicultural hub in the Greater Toronto Area.\n\n## Target Audience\nShifting demographics and changing lifestyles are driving the surge in food-service businesses. Busy consumers don't have the time or inclination to cook. More and more singles, working parents and elderly people are demanding greater convenience when it comes to buying their meals. Although, Mexican cuisine is popular among all ethnicities, hispanic/latino population will be the major targetted audience in this case. \n\n## Importance of this project\nA hard reality is that many restaurants fail during their first year, frequently due to a lack of planning. But that doesn't mean your food-service business has to be an extremely complex operation. In fact, the more streamlined you can make it, the better your chances for success. The results from this project will help an entrepreneur in food/hospitality sector in deciding the most suitable neighborhoods in Toronto to open a Mexican Restaurant. \n\n## Foursquare API\nIn this project I will use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n\n\n## Work Flow\nUsing credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n\n\n## Clustering/segmenting\nTo evaluate the existing Mexican restaurant in Scarborough, Toronto, I will explore the neighborhoods, segment them and group them into clusters to find the scarcity of Mexican restaurants.\n\n## Key Libraries\nPandas, Numpy, Folium, JSON, XML, Geocoder, Scikit Learn"
